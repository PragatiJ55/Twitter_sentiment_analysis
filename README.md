# Twitter_sentiment_analysis
This is the code for analyzing tweets based on a given topic in a given time period. It uses GetOldTweets3 rather than the Twitter API because Twitter API doesn't allow you to get tweets older than a week. With GetOldTweets3 API we can specify a time period and the maximum number of tweets we want. 
The code generates a bar graph of the sentiments found in the tweets.
